## proxy\_fan\_speed\_connections

This capability is applicable to newer fan drivers which create BUTTON\_LINK connections dynamically in association with fan speeds in the fan proxy. Setting this capability to true simply enables this ability. It relies on two other capabilities to successfully implement the dynamic connection functionality. They include: discreet\_levels and speed\_name.

###### Available from 3.4.2.
